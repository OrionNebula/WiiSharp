# WiiSharp
Interact with Wii remotes through a sleek managed API.

Information about how to connect to and interact with Wiimotes in Windows comes from [WiiUse](https://github.com/rpavlik/wiiuse).

In the back, this library uses P/Invoke calls to interact with the Wiimote as a HID. No managed API exists for some of these functions.
